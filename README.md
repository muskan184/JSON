<h1>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format widely used in web development and data exchange</h1> 

<h3>Here are its key features:</h3>

1. Lightweight
JSON is compact and uses minimal formatting, making it efficient for data storage and transfer.
2. Human-Readable
JSON is easy to read and write for humans, thanks to its simple syntax, which uses key-value pairs.
3. Language-Independent
JSON is language-agnostic and can be parsed and generated by almost every programming language, including JavaScript, Python, Java, and C#.
4. Structured Data
JSON supports hierarchical structures through nested objects and arrays, allowing complex data to be represented.
5. Compatibility with JavaScript
JSON is derived from JavaScript and is natively supported in the language, making it easy to use in web applications.
6. Key-Value Pair Structure
Data is organized as key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null.
7. Supports Arrays
JSON can store multiple values in an array, which can be easily looped through and manipulated.
8. Interoperable
JSON works seamlessly across different platforms, devices, and APIs, making it ideal for web services and RESTful APIs.
9. Extensibility
JSON can easily be extended by adding more key-value pairs, allowing for scalable data representation.
10. Self-Descriptive
JSON data is self-explanatory, making it easier to understand without requiring additional metadata.
